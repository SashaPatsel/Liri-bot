# Liri-bot
Liri-bot is an intelligent application run in the terminal with node.js

Liri communicates with three APIs: Twitter, Spotify and Omdb. Thse APIs return data to the user based on the query they enter into their terminal.

The possible commands include:
-my-tweets: returns my last 20 tweets

-spotify-this-song: returns data on the song entered into terminal after the command

-movie-this: returns data on the movie entered into terminal after the command

-do-what-it-says: returns spotify data for "I want it that way", but retrieves the song name from a separate .txt file.
